# Hello-Worlds

An array of multilingual versions of Hello World

Each file, other than this README file will output the phrase "Hello, World!"
This has been made to demonstrate the fact that all languages can be used,
but it is important to know why you use it.

This will follow the low-lib policy to minimize simplicity
